## 🧠 **Problem Statement**

Many readers struggle to discover books that align with their unique interests and reading preferences. Traditional recommendation engines often fall short by relying purely on user ratings or popularity metrics without understanding the reader's intent or taste.

There is a need for a **smart, personalized recommendation system** that can understand natural language input and suggest meaningful books based on it.

## 🎯 **Objective**

To develop a web-based application that leverages **Google Gemini AI** to recommend books to users based on their described interests. The application should be:
- User-friendly
- Visually appealing
- Technically scalable
- Easy to deploy on cloud platforms like Replit

## 🔄 **Workflow**

1. **User Interaction:**  
   User types their interest (e.g., "I want psychological thrillers with a female lead").

2. **API Call to Backend:**  
   The frontend sends this query to the FastAPI backend via POST `/recommend`.

3. **AI Processing:**  
   The backend uses Google Gemini API to process the user's input and match it against the book dataset.

4. **Response to Frontend:**  
   The AI returns a semantic list of book recommendations, which is then displayed neatly in the UI.
